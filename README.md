# nanatex (Network of Anatomical Texts)
This project is to visualize the interaction between the body parts from text-based information and from validated in dissection laboratory.
Multiple interactions between groups of bones and muscles like rotatores or longissimus were divided into each component interaction.  
The original information were obtained from the tables at Univ. of Michigan Medical School (http://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/coursepages/m1/anatomy2010/html/anatomytables/), which were permitted to use in this project by the courtesy of Professor Thomas R. Gest.
Landmarks from the WHO standard acupuncture point locations in the Western Pacific region were added (acupunctureList.xlsx). Dec 3, 2024
