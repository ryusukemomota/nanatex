# nanatex (Network of Anatomical Texts)
This project is to visualize the interaction between the body parts from text-based information.
The original information were obtained from the tables at Univ. of Michigan Medical School (http://www.med.umich.edu/lrc/coursepages/m1/anatomy2010/html/anatomytables/), which were permitted to use in this project by the courtesy of Professor Thomas R. Gest.
